# Change-Operation-Add-On
Add-on To Seamlessly Change Import/Export Format Inside Blender File View.

What's it for and why should you get it ?

Say you currently import or export using a specific format (it can be FBX, or OBJ, or whatever other format) and for some reason you want to change format.

Normally to do that you have to click on cancel, then on file, then on import, then finally you choose the new format.

Annoying...

With this add-on installed, just click on "Change Operation V1" tab in the tool bar inside the Blender File View and choose which format you want to use for import or export.

There are more options/buttons in the add-on :

- link

- append

- save

- save as

- open

- quit blender
